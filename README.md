This repository contains a proposition of the Cluster Exposure Verification (Cléa) protocol meant to warn the participants of a private event (e.g., wedding or private party) or the persons present in a commercial or public location (e.g., bar, restaurant, sport center, or train) that became a cluster because a certain number of people who were present at the same time have been tested COVID+.
